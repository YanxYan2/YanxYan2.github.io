    <h2>
        Maverick
    </h2>
    <p>
        <b>Captain Pete “Maverick” Mitchell (Tom Cruise)</b> <br>
        Tom Cruise reprises the role of Captain Pete Mitchell, who many think would <br>
        have been promoted past the status of captain by now. <br>
        He is more often referred to by his call sign “Maverick,” <br>
        and now he test-flies cutting edge planes for the navy.<br>
        Maverick tried his hand at becoming an instructor at Top Gun years ago, but he didn’t fit.<br>
        That is, until Commander Iceman calls him back to teach the best of the best<br>
        how to execute one heck of a mission.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Penny Benjamin
    </h2>
    <p>
        <b>Penny Benjamin</b> <br>
        Penny was the daughter of the Admiral the Pete fooled around with in the original “Top Gun.”<br>
        She now owns The Hard Deck bar near the Top Gun naval base in San Diego.<br>
        She remembers Pete as well as he remembers her, although she married someone else<br>
        and now has a daughter. Her husband remarried, so she is single.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Rooster
    </h2>
    <p>
        <b>Lieutenant Bradley “Rooster” Bradshaw (Miles Teller)</b> <br>
        When Warlock and Cyclone show Maverick the roster of students he will be training,<br>
        he immediately singles out Bradley Bradshaw, whose call sign is Rooster.<br>
        Rooster is Goose’s son, and Maverick not only has the emotional baggage from flying with Goose<br>
        (played by Anthony Edwards) back in “Top Gun” and losing him in an accident,<br>
        but now facing his son. Rooster’s mom asked Maverick to pull his papers from the naval academy,<br>
        which set him back four years in his career. Teller has starred in “The Spectacular Now” (2013)<br>
        “Whiplash” (2014), “Fantastic Four” (2015), the “Divergent” films and more recently, “The Offer” series as Alfred S. Ruddy.
